Hi! welcome to the first state management session!

fourth exercise - you already know how to do it...

in _character_ folder (path - src/screens/character/index.js)

inside the character component we have a useFetchCharacterById that gets an id from the URL
and fetches the character

same as we did in exercise 1 make the hook work we state!
